The human immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body from infection. One key component is the white blood cells, which patrol the bloodstream and tissues to identify and eliminate invading microorganisms. Some white blood cells produce antibodies—specialized proteins that bind to specific foreign molecules, marking them for destruction. The immune response is divided into innate and adaptive branches. The innate immune system provides rapid, non-specific defense through physical barriers such as skin and mucous membranes, and cellular responses like phagocytosis. The adaptive immune system, meanwhile, develops more slowly but with high specificity, forming immunological memory after exposure to pathogens. Vaccines leverage this memory: by exposing the immune system to a harmless form or piece of a pathogen, vaccines teach the body how to respond to a real infection. Nutrition and lifestyle influence immune function: adequate protein, vitamins (especially vitamin C and D), sleep, and regular physical activity support immune health, whereas chronic stress and poor sleep can impair it. Additionally, the microbiome — the community of beneficial microbes in the gut — plays a role in training and balancing immune responses. Understanding the interplay of these factors has led to modern preventive strategies in public health, from vaccination campaigns to nutrition programs aimed at vulnerable populations.
